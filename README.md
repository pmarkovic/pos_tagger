## General Information
Part-Of-Speech tagging is a NLP task for labeling words in a text with proper Part-Of-Speech tags. This task is useful for analyzing linguistic properties of a text, but it can be used for improving results on other tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis) as well. Example (from the Speech and Language Processing book, ch.8):
> There/PRO/EX are/VERB/VBP 70/NUM/CD children/NOUN/NNSthere/ADV/RB ./PUNC/

In this project, a neural model is trained on sample.conll data to perform the task.
